# Introduction to Deep Learning for NLP

Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to learn from data. Deep learning has revolutionized the field of NLP, and it is now the state-of-the-art for many NLP tasks.

## Why Deep Learning for NLP?

Traditional machine learning algorithms for NLP require a lot of feature engineering. This means that you have to manually extract features from the text data before you can train a model. This is a time-consuming and error-prone process.

Deep learning algorithms, on the other hand, are able to learn features automatically from the data. This makes them much easier to use and often leads to better performance.

## Key Concepts in Deep Learning for NLP

### Artificial Neural Networks

Artificial neural networks are a type of machine learning model that is inspired by the human brain. They are made up of a network of interconnected nodes, called neurons. Each neuron takes a set of inputs and produces an output.

### Word Embeddings

Word embeddings are a way of representing words as vectors of numbers. This allows deep learning models to work with text data. Word embeddings are covered in more detail in the next section.

### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a type of neural network that is designed to work with sequential data, such as text. RNNs have a "memory" that allows them to remember information from previous time steps.

### Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs)

Long short-term memory (LSTMs) are a type of RNN that is able to learn long-term dependencies. LSTMs are often used for tasks such as machine translation and speech recognition.

### Transformers

Transformers are a type of neural network that was introduced in 2017. They have been shown to be very effective for a variety of NLP tasks, and they are now the state-of-the-art for many tasks.

## Applications of Deep Learning in NLP

Deep learning is used in a wide variety of NLP applications, including:

*   Machine translation
*   Speech recognition
*   Text classification
*   Sentiment analysis
*   Question answering
*   Text summarization
*   Chatbots
