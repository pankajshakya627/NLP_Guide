# Named Entity Recognition (NER)

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is the task of identifying and classifying named entities in text into predefined categories such as person names, organizations, locations, and dates.

NER is a subtask of information extraction that is used to identify and extract structured information from unstructured text.

## Approaches to NER

There are three main approaches to NER:

1.  **Rule-based:** This approach uses a set of handcrafted rules to identify named entities.
2.  **Machine learning-based:** This approach uses machine learning algorithms to learn to identify named entities from a labeled dataset.
3.  **Hybrid:** This approach combines both rule-based and machine learning-based approaches.

## Python Example

This example shows how to use the spaCy library to perform NER on a piece of text.

```python
import spacy

# Load the English NER model
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

text = "Apple is looking at buying U.K. startup for $1 billion"

doc = nlp(text)

for ent in doc.ents:
    print(ent.text, ent.start_char, ent.end_char, ent.label_)
```

**Output:**
```
Apple 0 5 ORG
U.K. 27 31 GPE
$1 billion 44 54 MONEY
```

### Explanation

The output shows that spaCy has correctly identified the following named entities:

*   **Apple:** An organization (ORG)
*   **U.K.:** A geopolitical entity (GPE)
*   **$1 billion:** A monetary value (MONEY)

The output also shows the start and end character offsets of each named entity, as well as the label of the named entity.

### How it Works

spaCy's NER model is a statistical model that has been trained on a large corpus of text. The model uses a variety of features, including the words in the text, the part-of-speech tags of the words, and the shape of the words.

The model uses a technique called "word shape" to identify named entities. Word shape is a way of representing the capitalization of a word. For example, the word "Apple" has a word shape of "Xxxxx", while the word "apple" has a word shape of "xxxx". This can be a useful feature for identifying named entities, as named entities are often capitalized.
