# Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis is the task of identifying and extracting opinions from text. It is a subfield of NLP that is used to determine whether a piece of text is positive, negative, or neutral.

Sentiment analysis is often used to analyze customer feedback, social media posts, and product reviews.

## Approaches to Sentiment Analysis

There are three main approaches to sentiment analysis:

1.  **Rule-based:** This approach uses a set of handcrafted rules to identify the sentiment of a piece of text.
2.  **Machine learning-based:** This approach uses machine learning algorithms to learn the sentiment of a piece of text from a labeled dataset.
3.  **Hybrid:** This approach combines both rule-based and machine learning-based approaches.

## Python Example

This example shows how to use the TextBlob library to perform sentiment analysis on a piece of text.

```python
from textblob import TextBlob

text = "This is a great product. I am very happy with it."

blob = TextBlob(text)

# Get the sentiment polarity
polarity = blob.sentiment.polarity
print("Polarity:", polarity)

# Get the sentiment subjectivity
subjectivity = blob.sentiment.subjectivity
print("Subjectivity:", subjectivity)

if polarity > 0:
    print("Positive sentiment")
elif polarity < 0:
    print("Negative sentiment")
else:
    print("Neutral sentiment")
```

**Output:**
```
Polarity: 0.9
Subjectivity: 0.875
Positive sentiment
```

### Mathematical Foundation

The sentiment polarity is a float within the range [-1.0, 1.0]. The subjectivity is a float within the range [0.0, 1.0] where 0.0 is very objective and 1.0 is very subjective.

TextBlob's sentiment analysis is based on a pre-trained model that has been trained on a large corpus of movie reviews. The model uses a variety of features, including the words in the text, the part-of-speech tags of the words, and the presence of negation.

The sentiment of a piece of text is calculated by averaging the sentiment scores of the individual words in the text. The sentiment score of a word is a pre-defined value that is based on its polarity and subjectivity.
For example, the word "great" has a sentiment score of 0.8, while the word "bad" has a sentiment score of -0.7.

The sentiment of the text is then classified as positive, negative, or neutral based on the polarity score. A polarity score greater than 0 is classified as positive, a polarity score less than 0 is classified as negative, and a polarity score of 0 is classified as neutral.
