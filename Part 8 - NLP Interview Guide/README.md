# Part 8: NLP Interview Guide

Welcome to the **NLP Interview Guide**. This section is designed to be the ultimate resource for preparing for NLP-focused data science and machine learning interviews. 

We have compiled a massive list of questions ranging from basic linguistic concepts to advanced system design for Large Language Models. Each answer is provided with:
1.  **The Direct Answer:** A concise explanation suitable for an interview setting.
2.  **The Reasoning/Deep Dive:** A detailed breakdown of *why* that is the answer, often including mathematical intuition or architectural details.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
*   Master the most common "screening" questions (e.g., "What is the difference between stemming and lemmatization?").
*   Deepen your understanding of complex architectures like Transformers through rigorous questioning.
*   Learn how to approach open-ended system design problems (e.g., "How would you build a toxicity filter?").
