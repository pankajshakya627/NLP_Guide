# Essential Python Libraries for Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Python has a rich ecosystem of libraries for NLP. This section provides an overview of some of the most essential libraries that you will use in your NLP journey.

## 1. NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

*   **Website:** [https://www.nltk.org/](https://www.nltk.org/)
*   **Description:** NLTK is a comprehensive library for NLP that provides a wide range of tools and resources for tasks such as tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning. It is widely used for teaching and research.

## 2. spaCy

*   **Website:** [https://spacy.io/](https://spacy.io/)
*   **Description:** spaCy is a modern and efficient library for NLP that is designed for production use. It provides pre-trained models for a variety of languages and tasks, and it is known for its speed and accuracy.

## 3. scikit-learn

*   **Website:** [https://scikit-learn.org/](https://scikit-learn.org/)
*   **Description:** scikit-learn is a popular machine learning library that provides a wide range of algorithms for tasks such as classification, regression, and clustering. It also includes tools for feature extraction and model evaluation.

## 4. Gensim

*   **Website:** [https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/)
*   **Description:** Gensim is a library for topic modeling and document similarity analysis. It is particularly useful for working with large text corpora.

## 5. Transformers
