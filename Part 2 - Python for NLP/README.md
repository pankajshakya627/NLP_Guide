# Part 2: Python for NLP

This section focuses on the practical tooling required to build NLP applications. Python is the dominant language in this field, and we will set up a robust environment for development.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
*   Set up a Python virtual environment for NLP development.
*   Install and understand the role of key libraries like NLTK, spaCy, and scikit-learn.
*   Perform basic text manipulation tasks using Python.

### [2.1 Setting up the Environment](2.1_Setting_up_the_environment.md)
A step-by-step guide to:
*   Installing Python.
*   Creating Virtual Environments (`venv`).
*   Installing packages via `pip`.

### [2.2 Essential Python Libraries for NLP](2.2_Essential_Python_libraries_for_NLP.md)
An overview of the "Big 5" libraries:
1.  **NLTK:** The academic standard for learning NLP.
2.  **spaCy:** Industrial-strength, fast NLP.
3.  **scikit-learn:** For classical machine learning models.
4.  **Gensim:** For topic modeling and similarity.
5.  **Transformers (Hugging Face):** For state-of-the-art deep learning models.

### [2.3 Basic Text Processing with Python](2.3_Basic_text_processing_with_Python.md)
Hands-on code examples for:
*   **Tokenization:** Splitting text into words/sentences.
*   **Normalization:** Lowercasing and cleaning.
*   **Stopword Removal:** Filtering out common noise words.
*   **Stemming vs. Lemmatization:** Reducing words to their root forms.
