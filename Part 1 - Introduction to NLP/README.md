# Part 1: Introduction to Natural Language Processing

Welcome to the first section of the NLP Guide. This module is designed to provide you with a high-level understanding of the field before we dive into code and algorithms.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
*   Define what Natural Language Processing is and its goals.
*   Trace the evolution of NLP from the 1950s to the modern era.
*   Identify key applications of NLP in your daily life.
*   Understand the inherent difficulties and challenges in processing human language.

## 📂 Section Contents

### [1.1 What is NLP?](1.1_What_is_NLP.md)
An overview of the definitions, goals, and the interdisciplinary nature of NLP (combining CS, AI, and Linguistics).

### [1.2 History of NLP](1.2_History_of_NLP.md)
A journey through time:
*   **1950s:** The Turing Test and early rule-based systems.
*   **1990s:** The statistical revolution.
*   **2010s:** The deep learning era.

### [1.3 Applications of NLP](1.3_Applications_of_NLP.md)
Real-world examples of NLP in action:
*   Machine Translation (Google Translate)
*   Virtual Assistants (Siri, Alexa)
*   Email Spam Filtering
*   Sentiment Analysis

### [1.4 Challenges in NLP](1.4_Challenges_in_NLP.md)

Why is NLP hard? This file explains:

*   **Ambiguity:** "I saw the man with the telescope." (Who had the telescope?)

*   **Sarcasm & Irony:** Hard for machines to detect.

*   **Bias:** How models inherit human biases.



### [1.5 NLP vs. NLU vs. NLG](1.5_NLP_vs_NLU_vs_NLG.md)

Clarifying the confusion:

*   **NLP:** The broad field.

*   **NLU (Understanding):** Reading comprehension (Intent, Entities).

*   **NLG (Generation):** Writing text (Summarization, Responses).



### [1.6 The NLP Pipeline](1.6_The_NLP_Pipeline.md)

The standard workflow for building NLP apps:

1.  Data Acquisition

2.  Preprocessing

3.  Feature Extraction

4.  Modeling

5.  Evaluation

6.  Deployment
