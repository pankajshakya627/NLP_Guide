# Part 6: Advanced NLP Topics

This section covers specialized applications of NLP. These complex tasks often rely on the deep learning architectures learned in the previous section.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
*   Extract hidden themes from documents using Topic Modeling.
*   Summarize long texts automatically.
*   Understand how Machine Translation works and how to evaluate it.
*   Build systems that answer questions and hold conversations.

## 📂 Section Contents

### [6.1 Topic Modeling](6.1_Topic_Modeling.md)
Unsupervised learning for discovering themes:
*   **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA):** The math and intuition behind it.
*   Python example using `Gensim`.

### [6.2 Text Summarization](6.2_Text_Summarization.md)
Condensing information:
*   **Extractive:** Selecting key sentences (using `Sumy`).
*   **Abstractive:** Generating new summaries (using Transformers/Hugging Face).

### [6.3 Machine Translation](6.3_Machine_Translation.md)
Translating languages:
*   **History:** From Rule-based to Neural MT.
*   **Evaluation:** **BLEU Score**. Includes a detailed mathematical derivation and a solved example calculation.

### [6.4 Question Answering](6.4_Question_Answering.md)
Building systems that know the answers:
*   **Open-domain vs. Closed-domain.**
*   Python example using pre-trained pipelines.

### [6.5 Dialogue Systems and Chatbots](6.5_Dialogue_Systems_and_Chatbots.md)
Creating conversational agents:
*   **Architecture:** NLU, Dialogue Manager, NLG.
*   **Types:** Rule-based vs. Generative.
*   Python example of a simple chatbot.
